      I am in pre-final year of my Btech from ABES Engineering College. My journey in the world of programming began with Java, where I honed my problem-solving skills.
      My toolkit extends to the trio of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where I craft beautiful and responsive web interfaces. And when it comes to building powerful front-end applications, I turn to React.js and Next.js for their flexibility and scalability.
      On the back end, I thrive in the world of databases. MySQL is my trusted companion for managing data, while Node.js and Express.js empower me to create robust server-side applications. And letâ€™s not forget MongoDB, where I explore the wonders of NoSQL databases.
